# Logging
# -------
#
# Logging is covered with the <log> tag, which you may use to change
# the behaviour of the logging of the IRCd.
#
# An example log tag would be:
# <log method="file" type="OPER" level="default" target="opers.log">
# which would log all information on /OPER (failed and successful) to
# a file called opers.log.
#
# There are many different types which may be used, and modules may
# generate their own. A list of useful types:
# - USERS - information relating to user connection and disconnection
# - OPER - successful and failed oper attempts
# - KILL - kill related messages
# - FILTER - messages related to filter matches (filter module)
# - CONFIG - configuration related messages
# - COMMAND - die and restart messages, and messages related to unknown user types
# - SOCKET - socket engine informational/error messages
# - MODULE - module related messages
# - STARTUP - messages related to starting up the server
#
# You may also log *everything* by using a type of *, and subtract things out
# of that by using -TYPE - for example "* -USERINPUT -USEROUTPUT".
#
# Useful levels are:
# - default (general messages, including errors)
# - sparse (misc error messages)
# - debug (debug messages)
#
# Some types only produce output in the debug level, those are:
# - BANCACHE - ban cache debug messages
# - CHANNELS - information relating to joining/creating channels
# - CULLLIST - debug messages related to issues with removing users
# - RESOLVER - DNS related debug messages
# - CONNECTCLASS - Connection class debug messages
# - USERINPUT
# - USEROUTPUT
#
# If your server is producing a high levels of log messages you can also set the
# flush="[positive number]" attribute to specify how many log messages should be
# buffered before flushing to disk. You should probably not specify this unless
# you are having problems.
#
# The following log tag is highly default and uncustomised. It is recommended you
# sort out your own log tags. This is just here so you get some output.

<log method="file" type="* -USERINPUT -USEROUTPUT" level="default" target="ircd.log">

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#- WHOWAS OPTIONS -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#

# groupsize: Maximum entries per nick shown when performing
# a /WHOWAS <nick>.
groupsize="10"

# maxgroups: Maximum number of nickgroups that can be added to
# the list so that /WHOWAS does not use a lot of resources on
# large networks.
maxgroups="100000"

# maxkeep: Maximum time a nick is kept in the whowas list
# before being pruned. Time may be specified in seconds,
# or in the following format: 1y2w3d4h5m6s. Minimum is
# 1 hour.
